Hey everyone. I'm Carmine Cristallo Scalzi. You can call me CCS.

I'm a filmmaker, an illustrator, a musician, and a digital artist. My work is an exploration of how these disciplines intersect. My last feature film, "Sometimes in the Dark," is a dark fantasy that's now available on Amazon and streaming worldwide. I've also been developing a new dark fantasy universe with original characters from Elven mythology, and you can find my music on Spotify under my name.

For years, I've been obsessed with how art and technology intersect. And now, we're at a point where the tools we use are evolving at an insane speed. AI isn't just a buzzword; it's a new medium. It's a new language for creators.
I want to share my process, my discoveries, and my failures. I want to show you how I use tools like ComfyUI to build my own visual worlds, and how I'm exploring the next frontier of video generation, not as a gimmick, but as a filmmaker looking for new ways to tell stories.

Here in this repo I'm linking comfyUI workflows (free) for downloading.
